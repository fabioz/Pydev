	<h3>Remote Debugger</h3>
	<p>	
		In PyDev you can debug a remote program (a file that is not launched from within Eclipse). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The steps to debug an external program are:
		<ul>
			<li>Start the remote debugger server</li>
			<li>Go to the debug perspective</li>
			<li>Start the external program with the file 'pydevd.py' in its pythonpath</li>
			<li>Call pydevd.settrace()</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's see a simple 'step-by-step' example on how this works:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>1. Start the remote debugger server</strong>: To start the remote debugger server, you have to click the 
		green button pointed by '1' in the image below. After doing that, it will show a message in the console (indicated by '2') to
		confirm that the server is listening for incoming connections.

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>2. Go to the debug perspective</strong>: This is needed because it has no actual 'signal' that it reached a breakpoint when
		doing remote debugging. So, if you already have it open, just cycle to it with <strong>Ctrl+F8</strong>. Otherwise, go to the menu:
		window > Open Perspective > Other > Debug.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that there should appear a process named 'Debug Server' in the debug view (see '1' in the image below).

	<p>
		<strong>3. Make sure pydevd.py is in your pythonpath</strong>: This file is included in the org.python.pydev.debug plugin. So,
		you'll have to add it to the pythonpath. It's exact location will depend upon the eclipse location and the plugin version, being
		something like: eclipse/plugins/org.python.pydev.debug_x.x.x/pysrc/pydevd.py (so, the container folder must be in your pythonpath).
		If you choose to execute it from another machine, you need to copy all the files within that folder to the
		target machine in order to be able to debug it (if the target machine does not have	the same paths as the client machine,
		the file <strong>pydevd_file_utils.py</strong> must be edited to properly translate the paths from one machine to the other
		-- see comments on that file).
	</p>	
	<p>
		<strong>4. Call pydevd.settrace()</strong>: Now that the pydevd.py module is already on your pythonpath, you can use the 
		template provided: 'pydevd' to make the call: import pydevd;pydevd.settrace(). When that call is reached, it will automatically 
		suspend the execution and show the debugger.

<h3>Important Notes</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>NOTE 1</strong>: the settrace() function can have an optional parameter to specify the host where the remote
		debugger is listening. E.g.: <strong>pydevd.settrace('10.0.0.1')</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>NOTE 2</strong>: the settrace() function can have optional parameters to specify that all the messages
		printed to stdout or stderr should be passed to the server to show.
		E.g.: <strong>pydevd.settrace(stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>NOTE 3</strong>: You can have the running program in one machine and PyDev on another machine,
		but if the paths are not exactly the same, some adjustments have to be done in the target machine:<br/>
		Aside from passing the files in eclipse/plugins/org.python.pydev.debug_x.x.x/pysrc to your target machine, the 
		file <strong>pydevd_file_utils.py</strong> must be edited to make the path translations from the client
		machine to the server machine and vice-versa. See the comments on that file for detailed instructions on
		setting the path translations.
