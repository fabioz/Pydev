<p class="italic">"Personally, the pleasure I take in
    developping software is half linked to the language, half to the
    programming tools.

"PyDev is a core tool in our development process, and is a major reason
why Python has become viable for us as a production language.  I look
forward to each new release of PyDev as it is continually evolving into
a more and more powerful development environment."
