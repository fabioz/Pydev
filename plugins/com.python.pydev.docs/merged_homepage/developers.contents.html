<h1><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Gettingthecode"></a>Getting the code</h1>

<p>The first thing you probably want to do in order to code in PyDev is <b>getting its code</b>.</p>

<p><b>Pre-requisites:</b> Eclipse SDK 3.6.0, Git and Java 5.0 (note that other versions of those should work too but details may differ a bit)</p>

<p>Before getting the code, there's an important step you need to make: Change your java 'compiler compliance-level' to 5.0. To do this, go to <b>window &gt; preferences &gt; Java &gt; compiler</b> and change that setting from <b>1.4 to 5.0</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Repository"></a>Repository</h2>

<p>Get the code with Git from <a href="https://github.com/aptana/Pydev" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/aptana/Pydev</a> (ideally, fork it at github, create your own branch at the forked repository &#45;&#45; usually based in the development branch &#45;&#45; and later send a pull request on github so that the code can be merged back). Later, if you want to provide some other feature/bugfix, a new branch should be created again.</p>

<p>Then, in Eclipse, go to: <b>File &gt; Import &gt; Existing projects into workspace</b> and point it to the root of the repository you just downloaded.</p>

<p>Note that currently PyDev has a project (org.python.pydev.red_core) which has a dependency on Aptana Studio 3, so, if you plan on doing a local build, you'll need to get Aptana Studio 3 installed as a plugin in the SDK used for the build (i.e.: not necessarily in the SDK you use for developing), now if you don't need to do a local build (i.e.: just do your local changes and run Eclipse with your changes from within the SDK and contribute that as a patch later on), you can just close this project so that it doesn't get compiled.</p>

<p>Important: Before doing any changes to the code it's important to  note that you should create a new branch for doing code changes. See: <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://book.git-scm.com/3_basic_branching_and_merging.html</a> and also <a href="http://nvie.com/git-model" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://nvie.com/git-model</a> for details on creating and using branches.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: for running the tests, a file: <b>org.python.pydev.core/tests/org.python.pydev.core/TestDependent.OS.properties</b> must have the values set regarding to the computer that'll execute the tests.</p>

<p>If the head does not compile in git, send an e-mail to the pydev-code list at sourceforge to know what's  happening.</p>

<h1><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Wheretostart%3F"></a>Where to start?</h1>

<p>Ok, this may be the most difficult thing... especially because  answers may change a lot depending on what you want to do, so, below are outlined 2 different approaches:* Extending PyDev <b>with Jython</b>: recommended if you  want to add some editor-related action or something that does not need  implementing some Eclipse extension-point.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extending PyDev <b>in Java</b>: if you want something that won't map to an action, this might be the better way to go.<br/>
To start in any of those approaches it might be worth taking a look  at some Eclipse documentation, to try to grasp some of its concepts. One  of the finest documentations for that is the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Eclipse_FAQs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Eclipse FAQ</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to take the Jython approach, check out this article on how to do <a href="manual_articles_scripting.html" title="PyDev Jython Scripting">jython scripting in PyDev</a></p>

<p>For supporting a new Python based language, the first step would be  creating a grammar that can parse it while providing a Python like AST. See: <a href="developers_grammar.html" title="PyDev Grammar">PyDev Grammar</a> for instructions on that.</p>

<p>And that's it. If you have further doubts about how to code in PyDev, direct your questions to the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pydev-code" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">pydev-code list</a> at sourceforge.</p>

<h1><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Creatingadistributionlocally"></a>Creating a distribution locally</h1>

<p>Provided that the steps were followed, PyDev should have the following structure:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/builders<br/>
        /org.python.pydev.build</p>

<p>/features<br/>
        /org.python.pydev.feature</p>

<p>/plugins<br/>
        /org.python.pydev<br/>
        ... (other plugins)</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, on to the build: start a shell and follow the instructions at  /plugins/org.python.pydev.build/build_cmd.txt (read the end of the file  for details on customizing it properly)</p>

<h1><a name="PyDevDevelopers-Contributingback"></a>Contributing back</h1>

<p>If you do some change at PyDev that you want to contribute back to  the main trunk, you should create a patch and attach it to a bug in the sourceforge tracker with the title: <b>[PATCH] description of the patch</b></p>

<p><b>NOTE 1</b>: Diffs do not work well for binary files, so, if you made some change to some image, please attach the changed image itself, pointing the complete location to the image when attaching it to the bug.</p>

<p><b>NOTE 2</b>: If you did some whole new script that uses the 'jython scripting in PyDev' infrastructure, you do not need to create a patch. Just attach the script itself to the bug.</p>
