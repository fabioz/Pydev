<p>Ok, now that you're already up and running, let's <strong>run a program from within Eclipse</strong> with PyDev.
</p>

<p>For that, we will extend the module we created in the previous chapter with the following program:<br/><br/>
if __name__ == '__main__':<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print 'Hello World'<br/>
<br/>
Then, to run the file you can:
	<ul>
		<li>Use a shortcut: <strong>F9</strong> to run based on the project configuration where the module is contained.</li>
		<li>Go to the menu: Alt + R + S + The number of the Run you wish (It can be Python, Jython, unit-test, etc). 
		<li>Note: if you were using <strong>unit-tests</strong>, you could use: <strong>Ctrl+F9</strong> to run the unit-tests from the module (and even selecting which tests should be run).</li>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>NOTE</strong>: You can only run files that are in your project (so, you cannot run an external file -- this is
	an Eclipse limitation, and there are currently no ways of overcoming it).
</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/menu_run.png" border="1"/></p><br/>


<p>Doing so, the console should be brough forward with the output of the code (if you had some exception raised, clicking on
it would bring you to the code in the stack-trace).
</p>

<p>After the first run, if you type <strong>Ctrl+F11</strong>, the last file ran is re-run. Or, if you type just <strong>F11</strong>, a debug session is started with 
your last run. Let's test this...
</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This behavior changed in Eclipse 3.3 -- but it's generally recommended to restore it in the preferences at:
<strong>window > preferences > Run/Debug > Launching</strong> and set the Launch Operation to <strong>Always launch the previously launched application</strong>.
This tutorial will always consider this as the default option.  
</p>

<p>First, you'll need to add a breakpoint in the "print 'Hello World'" line. To do so, go to the line and type <strong>Ctrl+F10</strong> and select 
'Add breakpoint', then type <strong>F11</strong>. Doing so, will trigger you to go to the 'debug perspective'. You should say <strong>'yes'</strong> to this dialog.
</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/perspective_to_debug.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>After saying yes, you should be brought to the perspective below.
</p>

<br/><p align="center"><IMG src="images/debug_perspective.png" border="1"/></p><br/>

<p>In this perspective, the debug actions are activated and presented to you, so, you can use:<br/><br/>
<strong>F5</strong>: Step into<br/>
<strong>F6</strong>: Step over<br/>
<strong>F7</strong>: Step return<br/>
<strong>F8</strong>: Resume execution<br/>

</p>

<p>After the debug session, you can return to the previous perspective by typing <strong>'Ctrl+F8'</strong> (this keybinding
	iterates through the open perspectives)... And while we are at it, <strong>'Ctrl+F7'</strong> iterates through the
	views and <strong>'Ctrl+F6'</strong> iterates through the editors.
