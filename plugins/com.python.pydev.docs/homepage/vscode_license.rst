In short terms, the license allows anyone to evaluate **PyDev for VSCode** for 30 days, but it must be bought for continued use.

A **single-user license** can be used only by the person to which it's licensed for.

A **multi-user license** is to be obtained by an organization so that its employees can use it. It can be used by more than one person, but the number of developers using it within a week may not exceed the amount of users to which it was licensed for. (i.e.: If licensed for 2 developers, if 2 developers use it on Monday, it cannot be used by anyone else until the next Monday).

A license is **bought for a given version of the software** (i.e.: 0.X, 1.X) and must be **renewed for use in a new version** (but has no time-limit).
