Managing virtual environments in PyDev
===========================================


Managing virtual environments with pipenv
-------------------------------------------

PyDev 7.0.0 onwards has a tighter integration with pipenv to manage virtual environments.

Note: before starting, make sure you have it installed locally and understand how it works (see: https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for details).

After it's properly installed (i.e.: your can run **pipenv** from the command line) make sure the base interpreter for your virtual env is
configured inside PyDev (as explained in http://www.pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html).
