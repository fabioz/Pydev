<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ConfigureInterpreter"></a>Configure Interpreter</h1>

<p>After installing it, the first thing you must do is configure the <b>Python and/or Jython and/or IronPython</b> interpreter. <br/>
To configure the interpreter:</p>


<p><strong>1</strong>. Go to: <b>window &gt; preferences &gt; PyDev &gt; Interpreter - (Python/Jython/IronPython)</b>.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Choose the interpreter you have installed in your computer (such as python.exe, jython.jar or ipy.exe).</p>

<p>   Note that the <b>Auto Config</b> will try to find it in your PATH, but it can fail if it's not there (or if you
   want to configure a different interpreter).</p>

<p>   On <b>Windows</b> it'll also search the registry and provide a choice based on the multiple interpreters available
   in your computer (searching in the registry).</p>

<p>   On <b>Linux/Mac</b>, usually you can do a 'which python' to know where the python executable is located.</p>

<p>   On <b>Mac</b> it's usually at some place resembling the image below (so, if you want to configure a different version
   of the interpreter manually, that's where you'd want to search):</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="images/interpreter_mac.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></span><br/>
<strong>3.</strong> Select the paths that will be in your <b>SYSTEM PYTHONPATH</b>. </p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Select only folders that will <b>NOT be used as source folders for any project</b> of yours 
(those should be later configured as source folders in the project).</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT for Mac users</b>: The Python version that usually ships with Mac doesn't seem to have the .py source files
available, which are required for PyDev, so, using a different interpreter is recommended (i.e.: Download it from
<a href="http://python.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://python.org</a>). If you don't want to use a different 
interpreter, get the source files for the Python <strong>/Lib</strong> folder
and add those to the system installation. </p>

<p>After those steps, you should have a screen as presented below:</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="images/interpreter.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></span></p>
<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Howtocheckiftheinformationwascorrectlygotten"></a>How to check if the information was correctly gotten</h1>

<p>    The <b>System libs</b> must contain at least the Lib and the Lib/site-packages directory.</p>

<p>    The <b>Forced builtin libs</b> must contain the modules built into the interpreter (and others whose<br/>
    analysis should be done dynamically. See: <a href="#PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins">Forced Builtins</a>).</p>

<h1>How to work with virtual environments (virtualenv, conda, etc)</h1>

<p>For <strong>PyDev</strong>, a virtual environment works as any other <strong>regular Python executable</strong>, so, just click the <strong>New...</strong>
button and select the Python executable in the virtual environment -- just take care to <strong>double check the folders</strong> which are selected
when the virtual environment executable is used to make sure that you leave checked the <strong>/Lib</strong> folder from the base interpreter <strong>if</strong> the virtual environment
inherits the <strong>PYTHONPATH</strong> from a base installation).</p> 
	
<p> <strong>venv</strong> is the recommended way of managing virtual environments starting from Python 3.5. By default, venv will only symlinks to Python interpreter, and this
will cause the pip of the created virtual environments in Pydev showing all system installed site-packages. To get it displayed correctly, you will need to append "--copies" to the "python3 -m venv /path/to/venv"</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Whatifitisnotcorrect%3F"></a>What if it is not correct?</h1>

<p>    The most common error is having a problem in the environment variables used from the shell that spawned Eclipse,
    in a way that for some reason when getting the variables of one interpreter, it gathers the info from another
    interpreter (thus mixing the interpreter and the actual libraries).</p>

<p>    Usually running (from the command prompt) the file that gives that info for PyDev can help you discovering the
    problem in your configuration (interpreterInfo.py):</p>

<p>        That file is usually located at: eclipse\plugins\org.python.pydev_$version$\pysrc\interpreterInfo.py,
        but it can be at other location depending on how you installed it )</p>

<p> <strong>In Python</strong>:        python.exe interpreterInfo.py</p>

<p> <strong>In Jython</strong>:       java.exe -cp c:\path\to\jython.jar org.python.util.jython interpreterInfo.py </p>

<p> <strong>In IronPython</strong>:       ipy.exe interpreterInfo.py</p>

<p>    If you're unable to find out what's going on, please open an issue in the tracker (<a href="https://www.brainwy.com/tracker/PyDev">https://www.brainwy.com/tracker/PyDev</a> (giving the output obtained from
    executing interpreterInfo.py in your machine).</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-WhatifIaddsomethingnewinmySystemPYTHONPATHafterconfiguringit%3F"></a>What if I add something new in my System PYTHONPATH after configuring it?</h1>

<p>    Since PyDev 3.0, such modifications should be automatically detected by PyDev and require no further steps (so,
  if you <strong>pip</strong>-installed something or manually added it to a folder which is already in the <strong>PYTHONPATH</strong> 
  -- such as <strong>Lib/site-packages</strong> -- just wait a bit and PyDev should start considering it in code-analysis
   and code-completion). </p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Libraries"></a>Libraries</h1>

<p>    The <b>System libs</b> are the libraries that will be added to the PYTHONPATH of any project that is using this interpreter.</p>

<p>    For <b>Python and IronPython</b>, it's composed of <b>folders, zip files and egg files</b>. Note that if dlls should be added to
    the PYTHONPATH, the folders actually containing those dlls should be added, and they must have the same name to be
    imported in the code (the case is important). I.e.: if you want to import <strong>myDllModule</strong>, it <b>must</b> be called myDllModule.dll
    (note that .pyd and .so extensions are also accepted).</p>

<p>    For <b>Jython</b>, it's composed of <b>folders and jars</b>.</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins"></a><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins"></a>Forced Builtins</h1>

<p>    The Forced builtin libs are the libraries that are built-in the interpreter, such as <b>_<em>builtin</em>_, sha, etc</b> or
    libraries that should forcefully analyzed through a shell (i.e.: to analyze modules in this list, PyDev will spawn
    a shell and do a dir() on the module to get the available tokens for completions and code-analysis) &#8211; still,
    sometimes even that is not always possible, in which case, <a href="#PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-PredefinedCompletions">Predefined Completions</a> may be used to let PyDev know 
    about the structure of the code.</p>

<p>    For <b>Python</b>, you should have around <b>50</b> entries </p>

<p>    For <b>Jython</b> around <b>30</b> entries.</p>

<p>    For <b>IronPython</b> more than <b>100</b> entries. All the packages built into .NET should be included here &#8211; e.g.:
    Microsoft, Microsoft.Windows.Themes, System, System.IO, etc. </p>

<p>    Additionally, you may add other libraries that you want to treat as
    builtins, such as <b>os, wxPython, OpenGL, etc</b>. This is very important, because PyDev works 
    on the java side only with static information, but some modules don't have much information when analyzed
    statically, so, PyDev must create a shell to get information on those. Another important
    thing is that they <b>must</b> be on your System PYTHONPATH (otherwise, the shell will be unable to get that information). </p>

<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-PredefinedCompletions"></a><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-PredefinedCompletions"></a>Predefined Completions</h1>

<p>    Predefined completions are completions acquired from sources that provide only the interfaces for
    a given Python module (with Python 3.0 syntax).</p>

<p>    A predefined completion module may be created by having a module with the extension <strong>.pypredef</strong>
    with regular Python 3.0 contents, but with attributes having assigns to its type and methods having
    as the body a sole return statement &#8211; and the docstring may have anything.</p>

<p>    Example for a <b>my.source.module</b> (must be declared in a <b>my.source.module.pypredef</b> file):</p>

<p>    <b>Note 1</b>: the name of the file is the exact name of the module</p>

<p>    <b>Note 2</b>: .pypredef files are not searched in subfolders</p>

<p>    <b>Optionally a QScintilla .api file may be added</b>. When this is done, PyDev will try to create 
    .pypredef files from that .api file and will add the folder containing those to the PYTHONPATH.
    Note that this conversion is still in beta and the file may not be correctly generated, so,
    keep an eye for errors logged when a code-completion that would use those modules (while it
    will not fail, those completions won't be shown using the .pypredef files).
    In those situations, please create a bug-report with the .api file that generated incorrect code.</p>

<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Environment"></a>Environment</h1>

<p>    The variables defined at the environment will be set as environment variables when running a script that uses the 
    given interpreter (note    that it can still be overridden in the run configuration)</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Stringsubstitutionvariables"></a>String substitution variables</h1>

<p>    Strings defined here may be used in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>project configuration for source folders and external libraries</li>
	<li>launch configuration for the main module</li>
</ul>


<p>    They can be used in those places in the format: ${DECLARED_VARIABLE}</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Cygwinusers"></a>Cygwin users</h1>

<p>    PyDev currently has no support for cygwin. Currently you'll be able to configure the interpreter 
    with cygwin, but there are still other related problems (mostly on converting between windows and cygwin paths as needed).</p>
