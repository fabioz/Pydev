Release 5.3.0 (2016-10-12)
============================

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) onwards.

    * PyDev 5.2.0 is the last release supporting Eclipse 4.5 (Mars).
    * See: `update sites page`_ for the update site of older versions of PyDev.
    * See: the **PyDev does not appear after install** section on `the download page`_ for help on using a Java 8 vm in Eclipse.

* **Syntax validation for multiple grammars**

    * Helps to make code which is **Python 2 and 3 compatible**.
    * To customize, go to `Project Properties > PyDev - Interpreter/Grammar, and select`  **grammars for "additional syntax validation"**.

* **Code completion**

    * The code-completion can now do substring based matches (i.e.: the proposals will be shown if any part of the completion matches the requested name).
    * It's now the default (to revert to the mode which matches based on "startsWith", change the setting **"Preferences > PyDev > Editor > Code Completion > Match substrings on code completion?"** to false).
    * Completion proposals have the part of the completion used to do the match in bold.
    * Qualifiers of the completion (i.e.: package name) are styled differently (color may be customized in **General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts > Basic Qualifier Information Color**).
    * Completions are re-sorted when the name used to request a code completion changes.
    * **Sorting** is based on:

        * The current name typed (so that matches that are exact or start with the requested token appear first).
        * The type of the completion (parameter, local, context insensitive with auto-import, etc).
        * Where the completion was found (so, matches from the same project go first, referenced projects second and standard library last).

    * **Ctrl and Shift Behavior when applying code-completion proposal**

        * Ctrl is always **"replace the current name with the completion"** for all completions.
        * Pressing Ctrl to override the next name in code completion no longer looses the highlight in the editor.
        * On code completion with auto-import, for doing local imports, the pop-up must be focused and Shift must be kept pressed while the completion is applied.

* **PyQt5 support in Interactive Console**

    * PyQt5 may now be used as a backend in the interactive console so that widgets/plots can be inspected interactively while using the console.
    * May be activated with **%matplotlib qt5** (when using IPython) or in **"Preferences > PyDev > Interactive Console > Enable GUI event loop integration > PyQt5"**.

* Inital support for code-completion using **PEP 484 static type declarations**.

* **Debugger**

    * Fixed racing condition where the variables view would not be properly shown in the debugger -- which made an additional select of the stack required in order to show the variables (#PyDev-672).
    * Reusing the existing stack from the thread in the debugger (so that the expanded state of the variables is properly kept on step over).
    * Fixed issue changing attribute of local variable in the variables view (#PyDev.Debugger-56).
    * Fixed issue on attach to process: it required the pydevd_tracing to be at the top-level and it was moved to _pydevd_bundle (restored it to be a public API).

* **Indentation**

    * The default indent mode now changed to better follow PEP 8 guidelines:

        * Indenting directly after {, [, ( will add one indent level.
        * Indenting after another token in a line with a {, [, ( will indent to the {, [, ( level.

    * It's possible to restore previous indent modes (which either always indented to the parenthesis level or always indented a single level) in the preferences > PyDev > Editor > Typing.

* **Interactive console**

    * IPython 5 now supported in interactive console (#PyDev-710).
    * Fixed issue executing single line with multiple statements in console.
    * Fixed issue executing a multiple line statement in Jython.

* **Others**

    * The (fast) parser which detects the outline of a Python module now handles mixed indentation (and additional fixes which could result in log entries such as "Did not expect to find item below node: Assign...").
    * Support for unpacking generalizations (PEP 448) which could still result in a syntax error for the Python 3 grammar (#PyDev-701).

    - Building (indexing) of Python files is **much** faster.

    - Code completion does not get slown down by other analysis done in the background due to shell synchronization.


* **Interactive Console**:

    - The interactive console now has tab-completion (so, tab can be used to show completions such as in IPython).


* **Debugger**:

    - **Locals are now properly changed in the debugger** -- along with set next statement and auto-reloading this can make a debug session much more enjoyable!

    - Added a way to skip functions on a step-in on functions with **#\@DontTrace** comments:

        - **Makes it possible to skip a lot of boilerplate code on a debug session!**
        - Can be enabled/disabled in the debugger preferences;
        - Ctrl+1 in a line with a method shows option to add **#\@DontTrace** comment (if enabled in the preferences).

    - Debugging Stackless is much improved, especially for versions of Stackless released from 2014 onwards (special thanks to Anselm Kruis who improved stackless itself for this integration to work properly).

    - Reload during a debug session is improved and more stable:

        - Only updates what it can in-place or adds new attributes;

        - Shows what's being patched in the console output;

        - New hooks are provided for clients which may want to extend the reload;

        - See: `Auto Reload in Debugger <manual_adv_debugger_auto_reload.html>`_ for more details.



* **General**:

    - Compiled modules are now indexed, so, **fix import with Ctrl+1 now works with itertools, PyQt and other 'forced builtins'**.

    - When diffing a Python file, the PyDev comparison (with proper syntax highlighting) is now the default.

    - When finding a definition in a .pyd file, if there's a related .pyx in the same location, it's opened.

    - Running unit-tests will not try to import files that are in folders that don't have an __init__.py file.

    - Alt+Shift+O can be used to toggle mark occurrences.

    - Ctrl+3 not bound by default anymore on PyDev so that it does not conflict with the Eclipse Ctrl+3 (Ctrl+/ can be used instead).

    - Fixed recursion issue when finding file in pydev package explorer.

    - When configuring the interpreter, links are not followed when resolving entries for the PYTHONPATH.

    - It's possible to launch a directory containing a __main__.py file executable.

    - Fixed issues when creating django project without any existing project in the workspace.

    - Fixed deadlock on code-completion.

    - __pycache__ folders are hidden by default.


* **Organize imports**:

    - When saving a file, if automatically organizing imports, don't remove unused imports even if that option is checked.

    - When saving a file, if automatically organizing imports, and nothing changes, don't change the buffer (so, no undo command is created).

    - @NoMove can be used in an import so that the import organizer doesn't mess with it.



* **Refactoring**:

    - Fixed error when moving resource in PYTHONPATH to a dir out of the PYTHONPATH.

    - On a search make sure we search only python files, not dlls (which could give OutOfMemory errors and make the search considerably slower).

    - Multiple fixes on the rename module refactoring.

    -  Syntax highlighting now has options to have {}, [] and () as well
       as operators in different colors

    -  Code generation for classes and methods:

           Note that this is an initial implementation of the idea,
           aimed as those that use a TDD (Test Driven Development)
           approach, so, one can create the test first and generate the
           classes/methods later on from using shortcuts or quick-fixes
           (which is something that those using JDT -- Java Development
           Tools -- in Eclipse should be already familiar with). This
           feature should be already usable on a number of situations
           but it's still far from being 100% complete.

           -  Alt+Shift+S C can be used to create a class for the
              currently selected token
           -  Alt+Shift+S M can be used to create a method for the
              currently selected token
           -  Ctrl+1 has as a quick fix for creating a class or method

    -

       Debugger

           -  When discovering encoding on Python 3.x, the file is
              opened as binary
           -  Remote debugger (pydevd.settrace()) properly synchronized
           -  Fixed debugger issue on interpreter shutdown on Python 2.7

    -

       Bug fixes:

           -  Fixed issue when doing code-completion on a line that
              started with some token that started with 'import'. e.g.:
              import\_foo = a
           -  Fixed import when running unittest with coverage
           -  Fixed extract local (could extract to wrong location)

              used to see the results of tests and relaunching them
           -  The default test runner now allows parallel execution
              (distributing tests by module or individually)

       information and fixed broken shortcuts (e.g.: ctrl+z)

    -  Read-only files no longer editable in PyDev actions

    -  Fixed issue of remaining \\r on python 3.0 on input()

    -  The PyDev parser is now properly dealing with bom (utf-8)

    -  Assign to local: if method starts with '\_', the leading '\_' is
       not added to the local

Release 1.6.3
=============

-  Improved editor preferences page when using Aptana themes

   for css nor html (it can be restored at window > preferences >
   general > editors > file associations)

-

   **Globals Browser**

       -

          Improved message in globals browser to better explan its
          features:

              -  Exact match with a whitespace in the end
              -  CamelCase matching (so, entering only TC would be
                 enough to find a class named TestCase)
              -  Dotted names may be used to filter through the packages
                 (so, dj.ut.TC would find a TestCase class defined in
                 the django.utils package)

       -  Fix: When a space is added in the end, an exact match is done

       -  Fix: No longer restoring items that don't exist anymore

          editable
       -  2to3 only added in the context menu of projects with the PyDev
          nature
       -  If a debug session is terminated, no message saying that the
          variable can't be resolved in the hover is shown if the debug
          target is still selected

   classes.
-  **Debugger can use psyco for speedups**: see
   `http://pydev.blogspot.com/2008/02/pydev-debugger-and-psyco-speedups.html <http://pydev.blogspot.com/2008/02/pydev-debugger-and-psyco-speedups.html>`_.

   projects (working with code-completion, go to definition, etc).
-  **Jython Debugger**: Does not attempt to run untraced threads if
   version <= 2.2.1 (this was a Jython bug that's patched for the
   current trunk -- **note:** it prevented the debugger from working
   correctly with Jython).
-  **Project build**: Only referenced projects are rebuilt (and not all
   projects in the workspace -- e.g.: unreferenced c++ projects).
-  **Spell checking (depends on JDT)**: Integrated for comments and
   strings within PyDev (eclipse 3.4 should add the support for working
   without JDT. Reference:
   `http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/3.4/plan.php <http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-text/3.4/plan.php>`_).

   in the general preferences was conflicting with PyDev (those settings
   are now ignored)
-  **Patch by Laurent Dore**: Added filter for \*.py~ and comments
-  **Delete \*.pyc action**: also deletes \*.pyo files
-  **Ctrl+Click**: behaves exactly as F3.

-  Patch from **Oskar Heck**: debbugger can change globals
-  Added action to **delete all .pyc / $py.class** files
-  Added actions to **add/remove the PyDev configuration from a
   project** (previously, the only way to add a nature was to open a
   python file within a project).
-  **Ctrl+Shift+O**: When used with a selection will consider lines
   ending with \\ (without selection organizes imports)
-  Auto-add "import" string will not be added when adding a space in the
   case: from xxximport (just after from xxx)
-  Templates created with tabs (or spaces indent) are now converted to
   the indent being used in the editor
-  Hide non-PyDev projects filter working
-  Don't show assignments/imports after **if \_\_name\_\_ ==
   '\_\_main\_\_'**: in outline
-  **Code-completion**: after a completion is requested, pressing '.'
   will apply that completion (and if it has parameters, they'll not be
   added).
-  **Code-completion**: when a code-completion is applied with Ctrl
   pressed (toggle mode), parameters are not added.
-  **Assign to local** variable/attribute handles **constants**
   correctly.
-  **psyco** changed for Null object for **debug** (so, no changes are

New on: 1.3.7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Support for Eclipse 3.3**

**Bug Fix**: Interpreter modules not correctly set/persisted after
specifying interpreter (so, the builtins and other system libraries
would not be available in completions).

`Mylyn <http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/>`_ integration.

**Open With PyDev**: does not appear for containers anymore.

**Code-completion:**

The folowing cases are now considered in code-completion to discover the
type of a variable:

-  assert isinstance(obj, Interface) -- default from python
-  assert Interface.implementedBy(obj) -- zope
-  assert IsImplementation(obj, Interface) -- custom request
-  assert IsInterfaceDeclared(obj, Interface) -- custom request

-  a = adapt(obj, Interface) -- pyprotocols
-  a = obj.GetAdapter(Interface) -- custom request
-  a = obj.get\_adapter(Interface) -- custom request
-  a = GetSingleton(Interface) -- custom request
-  a = GetImplementation(Interface) -- custom request

New on: 1.3.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Bug Fix:** Builtins were not correctly used after specifying
   interpreter (so, the builtins would not be available in
   completions/code-analysis).

   specified.

New on: 1.3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Eclipse 3.3 Integration:** Does not keep eclipse from a correct
shutdown anymore.

-  The initial columns with whitespaces that are common for all the
   docstring is now removed.
-  The previous size of the pop-up window in completions is now
   restored.

**Extract method refactoring:** was not adding 'if' statement correctly
on a specific case.

**Organize imports:** (Ctrl+Shift+O): comments are not erased in import
lines when using it anymore.

**Interpreter Config:** solved a concurrency issue (which could issue an
exception when configuring the interpreter).

**Jython integration:** can now work with a j9 vm.

**Jython integration:** those that don't use jython can now use eclipse
without JDT (but it's still required for jython development).

**Outline:**

-  The comments are now set in the correct level (below module, class or
   method).
-  Comments are sorted by their position even when alphabetic sorting is
   in place.
-  Comments are added to the outline if they start or **end** with
   '---'.

New on: 1.3.4

-  **Debugger:** Performance improvements (it will only actually trace
   contexts that have breakpoints -- it was doing that in a module
   context before).
-  **Debugger:** Step over correctly stops at the previous context.

   preferred browser in the PyDev perspective.

New on: 1.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **PyDev Editor:** If multiple editors are open for the same file, a
   parser is shared among them (which greatly improves the performance
   in this case)

   to dedent to legal levels)
-  **PyDev Editor:** sometimes the 'import' string was added when it
   shouldn't
-  **Fix: Code-completion:** case where a package shadows a .pyd is now
   controlled (this happened with mxDateTime.pyd)

   the PyDev wizard it was halting in some platforms
-  **Fix: ${string\_prompt} in run config**: now only evaluated on the
   actual run
-  **Fix: Code-Completion**: jython shell was not handling
   java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError correctly

   to see what this fixed)
-  **Block Comments**: The remove block comments (Ctrl+5) will now
   remove contiguous comments -- if several lines are commented, putting
   the cursor in any of those lines and pressing Ctrl+5 will remove all
   those comments
-  **Launch**: When creating a new launch, the 'default' option is
   chosen, so, if the default interpreter changes later, this won't
   affect existing launch configurations

   completion anymore
-  **Code Completion**: completions for cls on classmethods now works
   correctly

   there, but its keybinding is removed, so, users have to configure
   themselves which keybinding they want for it)
-  Assign to local or field variable now enters in linked mode
-  Added dependency to Eclipse 3.2 features, as version 1.2.0 of PyDev
   and newer are only Eclipse 3.2 compatible.

New on: 1.0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Another batch of things to improve **indentation**:

   -  Indent does not try to make auto-indentation when pasting
   -  When smart-indent is not selected, it will still add an
      indentation level after ':'
   -  It will keep the indent of the previous line on new-lines if the
      current line is empty

New on: 0.9.8.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   NOTE: it still needs some work.
-  **Changes in the shell spawning were done, and no hangs should appear
   when trying to do code-completion anymore** (if it still hapens,
   please report it as a bug -- NOTE: a little delay on the first time
   code-completion is executed is expected, as this is the time the
   shell is started).
