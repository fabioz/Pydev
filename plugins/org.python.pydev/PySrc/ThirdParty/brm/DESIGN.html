    <h1>Bicyclerepairman Design</h1>

This information is correct at 27th Jan 2004.


	<h2> Bike Component Interface </h2>
	<pre>
import bike

ctx = bike.init()
ctx.renameByCoordinates("/home/joe/src/foo/bah.py",52,8,"bah")
ctx.save()
ctx.undo()
	</pre>


<h2>File System Dependency:</h2>

Bicyclerepair man operates off of the file system. Modules are loaded
from the file system, and saved back after a refactoring. Integration
with IDEs currently relies on the IDE ensuring that the files on disk
are up-to-date before performing a query or refactoring, and is
responsible for reloading the modified files after the operation.


<!--
<h2>Example: - findDefinition</h2>
Client code calls findDefinition via the context object in
bikefacade.py. The client passes in a filename and coordinates of a reference she wants to find the definition of. 

The bikefacade module sets a search path (based on PYTHONPATH and the
position of the file in a package hierarchy) and then calls
the findDefinition module in the query package.

The findDefinition module loads the file into a Module object via the
getModule() call in the parsing package.

<h2>Parsing and Fastparsing - the <em>parser</em> package</h2>
<p>
BRM originally did all its parsing using the Python compiler package
(see python docs). This parser generates very accurate
AST. Unfortunately this proved to be far too slow for interactive use,
and so I built a seperate parser which does a basic job of parsing,
but very fast. BRM uses this basic parser to locate and navigate round
the code, and then applies the compiler package to small bits of code
where necessary.
</p>

<p>
The fastparser module in the parsing package operates on a single
module at a time. It generates a simple tree containing Class and
Function nodes, with a Module node at the root. This tree is called
the 'fastparserast', and it's nodes (Module,Class,Function) are
defined in the fastparserast module. Each fastparserast node contains
a pointer to the start and end lines of the node in the source text,
and basic information (e.g. name). It also contains methods for
navigating between nodes (e.g. getChildNodes(), getParent()
</p>

<h3>BRM Tricks - masking the code</h3>

<p>
The fastparser is very fast because it leverages the power of the
regex package, and has been carefully profiled and optimised. Before
parsing a file it applies a number of regexes over the source to mask
out all the comments and strings. This then allows it to scan the
source very quickly for functions and classes using python keywords
('class', 'def') without fear of getting confused by occurences of
keywords in strings. It builds up a tree of functions and classes in a
module, storing their start and end positions (lines) in the source
text.
</p>


<h3> BRM Tricks2 - logical lines and doctored lines</h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, the compiler module is very accurate but very
slow. Because of this, BRM uses it sparingly, choosing only to parse
lines of code when it is reasonably confident that the line contains
something important.
</p>
<p>
In order to parse a single line of source code, the line must
sometimes be doctored to make it parsable. Take for example the
following:
<pre>
def foo(a, b, c):
</pre>
This line cannot be parsed on its own, but may contain some
interesting code. BRM overcomes this constraint via the
	makeLineParseable() function in the parserutils module. This
	function decorates the line with noops that make it parsable. For
	the above example it generates the following code:
<pre>
def foo(a, b, c):
    pass
</pre>

Which parses fine.
</p>

<p>
The other problem with parsing single lines of code is that python
statements often span multiple lines. e.g.
<pre>
myref =  foo(arg1, arg2, 
             arg3, arg4)
</pre>

To combat this problem, BRM has a neat function called
generateLogicalLines() (also on the parserutils module). This function
takes a list of (masked) physical lines as input, and generates
complete 'logical' lines as output.


<h2>Querying the code - The <em>query</em> Package</h2>

<p>
As mentioned above, the relative slow speed of the compiler module
prohibits BRM from building up an AST of the entire file and then
navigating it. Instead the query package uses text searches to narrow
down the search and then parses single 'logical lines' using the
compiler.
</p>


<h3>logical lines and doctored lines</h3> 
<p>
In order to parse a single line of source code, the line must
sometimes be doctored to make it parsable. Take for example the
	  following:

<pre>
a = myfunc(arg1, arg2,
           arg3, arg4)
</pre>

<pre>
def foo(a, b, c):
</pre>



The first problem is
multiline lines.
</p>

<h3>Example - findDefinition</h3>
<p>
For example, when searching for the definition of a reference (see
findDefinition.py), BRM first takes the input coordinates and locates
the fastparserast node denoting the class/function scope containing
the reference (by checking the coords against the start/end coords of
the fastparserast nodes). This provides the initial search scope for
the query.
</p>

<p>
BRM then obtains the sourcecode of the scope with strings/comments
	  masked out. It searches
